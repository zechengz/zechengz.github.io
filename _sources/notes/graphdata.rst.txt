GraphDataset Object
==============
This is a python object that models a dataset as a list of DeepSNAP Graphs.

Arguments
-----------------
- graphs: a list of Graph
- task: task this GraphDataset is used for 
- edge_negative_sampling_ratio: number of negative samples compared to that of positive data
- edge_message_ratio: number of training edge objectives compared to that of message-passing edges
- edge_train_mode: which mode to train edges with

Methods
-----------------
- __len__: returns the number of graphs in this data object
- num_node_features: returns the numbers of features per node
- num_edge_features: returns the numbers of features per edge
- num_node_labels: returns the numbers of labels per node
- num_edge_labels: returns the numbers of labels per edge
