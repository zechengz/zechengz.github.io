Following is the my Chinese name characters written by the most famous Chinese calligrapher Xizhi Wang (303 - 361). The charaters are Zhang, Ze and Cheng from the left to the right.
(I captured them from Xizhi&amp;rsquo;s different script works and concatenated them into one image)
The meaning of my name in Chinese characters:
å¼ Zhang: My family name was originated more than two thousand years ago and now there are more than 80,000,000 people with this family name.</description></item></channel></rss>
